## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Build tool

### What I learned

How to effectively convert design into responsive website using technologies
such as SASS and Parcell for development.

### Continued development

I have created a base structure for the SASS files but i belive they can be more organized and optimized.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me for setting up box shadow with just a click.
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - The perfect place for CSS Rest.
- [Sass @import, @use and @forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0) - clearly explain what they were and how i could use them on the project.
- [ColorSlurp](https://colorslurp.com/) - I used to detect the collor accurelty from my design document.
